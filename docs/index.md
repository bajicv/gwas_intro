# Welcome to Intoduction to GWAS

This tutorial is part of the Bioinformatics for Biologists course at FU-Berlin. The assumption is that you have access to `evop-login.imp.fu-berlin.de` where the data is stored. 

At the end of this two-day tutorial, you should get familiar with plink and the basic workflow in GWAS, and with computing polygenic risk scores. 

During the first day, we will cover data QC for GWAS, and during the second day, we will perform the association analysis and compute PGS.
